# PomPom Timer

A lightweight, stripped-down, and minimal [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer. I thought it would be fun to build my own version of the ubiquitous timer used by people all over the world (and put my own spin on it in the process). Enter the PomPom Timer, a simple-yet-streamlined version that trades the tomato for the pomegranate.
